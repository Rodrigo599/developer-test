## About

This repository is intended to be part of a developer test.

## Assignement

Unlocking Achievements

You need to write the code that listens for user events and unlocks the relevant achievement. 

For example;

When a user writes a comment for the first time they unlock the “First Comment Written” achievement.

When a user has already unlocked the “First Lesson Watched” achievement by watching a single video and then watches another four videos they unlock the “5 Lessons Watched” achievement.

## AchievementUnlocked Event

When an achievement is unlocked an AchievementUnlocked event must be fired with a payload of; 

achievement_name (string)
user (User Model)

## BadgeUnlocked Event

When a user unlocks enough achievement to earn a new badge a BadgeUnlocked event must be fired with a payload of; 

badge_name (string)
user (User Model)

## Achievements Endpoint

There is an endpoint `users/{user}/achievements` that can be found in the ‘web’ routes file, this must return the following;

unlocked_achievements (string[ ]) 
An array of the user’s unlocked achievements by name

next_available_achievements (string[ ])
An array of the next achievements the user can unlock by name. 

Note: Only the next available achievement should be returned for each group of achievements. 

Example: If the user has unlocked the “5 Lessons Watched” and “First Comment Written” achievements only the “10 Lessons Watched” and “3 Comments Written“ achievements should be returned.

current_badge (string) 
The name of the user’s current badge.

next_badge (string)
The name of the next badge the user can earn.

remaining_to_unlock_next_badge (int)
The number of additional achievements the user must unlock to earn the next badge. 

Example: If a user has unlocked 5 achievements they must unlock an additional 3 achievements to earn the “Advanced” badge.

## Test Coverage

You should write tests that cover all possible scenarios and would, in a real world project, make you confident there are no bugs and it is safe to deploy to production.

## Launching

For initial values, you should run migrations along with seeders.

Run migrations for tables:
php artisan migrate

Run seeders for initial badges and achievements:
php artisan db:seed

Tests are done using other database connection, already setup in phpunit.xml
